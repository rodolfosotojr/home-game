# Home Game

A mobile first web application that returns the location of professional home sports games for a given date range and city as well as the distance from an origin location to the destination.

## Deployment

To use this app, simply open index.html in a local browser.

You need to disable CORS to use the google maps API on this application as of now. We recommend temporarily disabling this setting using an extension such as this: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi

Please re-enable CORS when not testing this application as it can expose you to secruity vulnerabilities in day to day use. 

## Next Steps

The logic used in this app can be altered slightly to make it available for use for many other genres other than professional sports. Musicals, plays, college sports, and many other options can be taylored to.

Integration with purchasing centers and a personalized user experience seems the logical next step to give users a one stop shop for their traveling needs.
